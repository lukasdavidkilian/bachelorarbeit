# Job Application System

This project is a Python-based job application system. It models the process of job application, from the perspective of both the applicant and the company offering the job.

## Components

The system is composed of several classes, each representing a different entity in the job application process.

### Applicant

The `Applicant` class represents a job applicant. It contains attributes for the applicant's first name, last name, email, and resume. It also includes methods for applying to a job, checking if the applicant has already applied to a job, and withdrawing an application.

### Job

The `Job` class represents a job. It contains attributes for the job's name, the company offering the job, the applicants who have applied for the job, and the recruiter responsible for the job.

### Company

The `Company` class represents a company. It contains attributes for the company's name, the jobs offered by the company, and the employees of the company.

### Interview

The `Interview` class represents an interview. It contains attributes for the application associated with the interview, the interviewer, and the date and time of the interview.

### Application

The `Application` class represents a job application. It contains attributes for the applicant, the job, the interviews associated with the application, and the status of the application. It also includes methods for scheduling an interview, reading a PDF (such as a resume), scanning a CV, and determining whether an applicant should be invited for an interview based on their CV.

### Employee

The `Employee` class represents an employee. It contains attributes for the employee's first name, last name, email, and position.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are included for the `Application` and `Applicant` classes in the `test_application.py` and `test_applicant.py` files, respectively. These tests ensure that the methods in these classes work as expected.

## Usage

To use this system, create instances of the `Applicant`, `Job`, and `Company` classes. Then, use the methods of these instances to simulate the job application process. For example, an applicant can apply for a job, a company can post a job, and an application can schedule an interview.

## Documentation

For more detailed information about each class and method, please refer to the docstrings and comments in the code. The docstrings follow the standard Python conventions and provide information about the purpose of each method, its parameters, and its return value.

## Future Enhancements

This project is a basic implementation of a job application system. Future enhancements could include adding more features, such as a user interface, a database to store applications, and more advanced methods for analyzing CVs.
